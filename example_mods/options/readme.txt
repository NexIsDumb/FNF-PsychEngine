Put your custom json options here
Place them inside folders with the name of the class where you want to use them
(Check Psych Engine's official GitHub for options classes names and for the options variables)
Folder name Example: VisualsUISubState

The variables you could and should use are the same of Psych Engine's normal options
If the option name variable is null, the game will use json file name.
